Ergo, he is a statist - the opposite of an  anarchist.  I know a guy who says that, when he gets old and his teeth fall out, he'll quit eating meat.  Would you call him a vegetarian?"},{"comment_text":"Carioca RFA \n\nThanks for your support on my request for adminship.\n\nThe final outcome was (31\/4\/1), so I am now an administrator.

However, there are modern, scientifically-accepted variants of catastrophism that have nothing to do with creationism \u2014 and they're even mentioned in the article!  I think the connection to pseudoscience needs to be clarified, or the article made more general and less creationism-specific and the category tag removed entirely."},{"comment_text":"(and if such phrase exists, it would be provided by search engine even if mentioned page is not available as a whole)"},{"comment_text":", 9 October 2007 (UTC)\n\nP.s, the delta function I use in the example above as  is the Kronecker delta, not the Dirac delta. The Kronecker delta is in , whereas the Dirac delta is not in L2[0,1].\n\nIncidentally, in response to the request for examples, L2(X) is not a RKHS for X any open subset of . On the other hand, Hardy spaces usually are RKHSs, using various variants of the Szego kernel.\n\nFor example , the Hilbert space of L2 functions on the circle is not a RKHS.

I thought I'd just ask for your thoughts. It might be easier to just undo the substitution and redirects. -XT+"},{"comment_text":"Quoting Loremaster: In order to make sure you understand me"}]
